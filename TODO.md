## 3. Core / Architecture Improvements

| Item | Priority | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Abstract `AbstractPrompt`** — decouple `Terminal::readKey()` | P1 | 🔴 | Inject a `KeyReader` interface so components can be tested without a real terminal |
| **`Component` base** — remove direct `echo` from `render()` | P1 | 🔴 | Components should write to an `OutputInterface` buffer, not `STDOUT` directly. Enables headless rendering. |
| **Windows support** — full VT100 parity | P1 | 🔴 | `Terminal::readKey()` on Windows needs a separate implementation (no `stty`, use `ReadConsoleInput` via FFI or `sapi_windows_*`). Currently usable only in Windows Terminal / modern CMD. |
| **Async / non-blocking loop** | P2 | 🔴 | Optional event loop hook (e.g. Swoole / ReactPHP / Revolt) so components can run inside coroutines without blocking the main thread |
| **`IRenderer` diffing** | P2 | 🔴 | Implement dirty-region diffing in `Renderer` to only repaint changed lines, reducing flicker on slow terminals |
| **`State` serialization** | P2 | 🔴 | `State::toArray()` / `State::fromArray()` for save/restore across TTY sessions |
| **Component composition** | P2 | 🔴 | Allow embedding one component inside another (e.g. `TextInput` inside `Autocomplete` without copy/paste) |
| **Global `$this->ask()` shortcuts** return typed values | P2 | 🔴 | `AbstractCommand::askNumber()`, `askDate()`, `askPassword()` factory methods |
| **PSR-14 event dispatcher** | P3 | 🔴 | Replace `Hooks` with a PSR-14 compatible dispatcher, keep `Hooks` as a lightweight default |

## 7. Long-Term Goals

These are aspirational goals for when the library has a stable user base.

### v1.x — Stabilization

- Lock the public API (no breaking changes)
- > 80% test coverage with mutation score
- All P1 items above resolved
- Windows Terminal fully supported
- Listed on Packagist with > 100 installs/month

### v2.0 — Architecture Evolution

- `KeyReader` interface — fully testable components, no `STDIN` dependency
- `OutputBuffer` abstraction — components write to a buffer, not `STDOUT` directly
- PSR-14 event dispatcher
- Optional async/event-loop integration (Revolt / Swoole)
- Support for multi-column layouts (side-by-side components)

### Community Goals

- [ ] Published on Packagist (`alfacode-team/php-io-cli`)
- [ ] `CONTRIBUTING.md` includes "good first issue" labels guide
- [ ] At least 3 external contributors
- [ ] Listed in [Awesome PHP](https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php)
- [ ] Compared favorably to Laravel Prompts / Symfony Console in benchmarks
- [ ] Documented integration with Laravel Zero, Symfony, and standalone PHP CLI apps
